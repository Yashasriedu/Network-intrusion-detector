# Network-intrusion-detector
To build a network intrusion detector that aims at distinguishing between a good connection (normal) or a bad connection (intrusions/attacks). This problem is basically a Binary classification problem. The dataset was created by Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security. It reflects modern low footprint attacks. The dataset comprises of modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours. The dataset given to us was divided into two parts which are the training data and testing/validation data. The files are UNSW_NB15_training-set_csc215.csv and UNSW_NB15_test-set_csc215.csv respectively. We have dealt with the datasets separately, wherein the training set consists of 175341 rows × 45 columns and the testing set consists of 82332 rows × 45 columns. The dataset has 45 features with the class label. The label is the output column that records 0 if the record is normal and 1 if the record is an attack.
